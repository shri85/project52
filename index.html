                <li>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.</li>
                <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</li>
                <li>Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.</li>
                <li>Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!</li>
                <li>When a camel finally does find water, he can drink up to 40 gallons in one go.</li>
